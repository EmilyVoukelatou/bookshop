Description:
    The 'bookshop new' command creates a new Bookshop project with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    bookshop new ~/Projects/NewBookProject

    This generates a skeletal Bookshop installation in ~/Projects/NewBookProject.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
